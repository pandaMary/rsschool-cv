## Profile 

 - I'm a lawyer by my first education. But this profession did't inspire me. So I
   decided to do what I really like. 
   
 - I've worked as a copywriter and
   content-manager for last 10 years. I wrote texts on a variety of
   topics, worked with different CMS, took part in promoting successful
   Belarusian and Russian projects, helped  create cool and useful
   resources for people. 
   
 - For one project I had to learn the basic
   information about HTML/CSS and JS-script. It was interesting for me.
   That's why I decide to go further and become a real JS-developer.
